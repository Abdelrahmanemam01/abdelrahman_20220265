I have conducted a task titled Sentiment Analysis, in which I implemented a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with 128 neurons for sentiment classification. The model architecture included an embedding layer for word representation and a Sigmoid activation function in the output layer for binary classification. The necessary preprocessing steps were performed to clean and prepare the data.

The model was trained and executed on Google Colab, where it was also saved for later use. Subsequently, the trained model was tested using Jupyter Notebook.

For this task, I employed the IMDB dataset, which consists of movie reviews along with their corresponding sentiment labels. The dataset is available at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews/data
